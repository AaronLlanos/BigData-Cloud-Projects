It snowed huge snow flakes.  Accumulation was just 	about 1/4 inch. The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so 	it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.  It 	just felt like Christmas.  We took a  carriage ride around Central Park and 	they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.  Met one of my contacts 	at Prebon for lunch and he  paid for it. .  Good  thing because we were 	drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.  We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion 	King.  Excellent. Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever 	seen.  The music was awesome.  Lion King had great special effects with all 	of the costumes. The people were dressed like animals and it was really 	cool.    Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz. 	level.  In other words-perfect seats.  On Saturday, we mostly shopped during 	the day.  Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring  and red leathe 	coat. You can't believe the people that were shopping.  We went to FAO 	Schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building 	to get in.  The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.  	You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.  I have never seen 	so many mink coats in my life.  Everyone had one on.  The hotel we stayed at 	was excellent.  It didn't have the view you did.  Nothing will ever match 	that.  But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and 	nicely decorated.  All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one 	hour.  We ate at some good restaurants too.  The first night was this small 	Italian restaurant.  Very authentic.  They took good care of us.  The second 	night was Thai-food was excellent.  The third day was French.  YUM YUM.  We 	got out of town just in time.  We really lucked out.  I would go back agai n 	if the right opportunity came up.

Also let's discuss 	any equipment needs you might need such as a data line for access to Internet 	and any audio video equipment so I can have it arranged.??

I believe at the Biltmore we have a 	special rate if you mention that its for SoCalGas.		I'll be telecommuting tomorrow so you can reach me at my cell phone at (213) 	248-4053.

The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts 	to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  	of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and 	the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a 	minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.		The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the 	Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that 	this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to 	as Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could 	be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is 	implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock 	border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  		SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock 	delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the 	capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They 	also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum 	of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if 	their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo 	until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being 	established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.		Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a 	reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.		After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:		Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not 	relate to receipt point rights.		1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);		2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)		3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or 	Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they	 give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up 	like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from 	Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.		4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:		   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock	Texaco   40    135	Burlington  26    74	Aero   5    15	Borax   7    12	LADWP  0    36	SWGas   0    20		5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:		Expansion Shippers  78000 	Socal Gas           425000	BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 	El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)	Total 851000	540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.		The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and 	felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off 	the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.		Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El 	Paso's counter -proposal.  		Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent 	thruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other 	forms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge 	Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as 	converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the 	producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, 	they would not pay anything.		Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their 	deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For 	volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric 	rate.		Bottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this 	case.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will 	study  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.		Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived 	gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more 	gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could 	be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  	El Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan 	based on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 	2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings 	andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a 	technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets 	resolved.		Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the 	keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the 	bondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, 	Southern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you 	advised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.

Randy continues to do an excellent job.  He anticipates questions and usually 	has the answers.  He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on 	his knowledge base.  He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha 	points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very 	valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.  The only area for 	improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his 	opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say 	anything or go along with the status quo.  He tends to want to be 	nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment 	and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.

The data was taken from the VISA	system (note the index numbers on the spreadsheet) and is presented	graphically and as tabular values.		The flow west on the southern system is shown as the sum of west flow	through Pecos River and Waha stations less the east flow from Cornudas.	This represents the net volume flowing west from Cornudas Station into the	combined low and high pressure southern systems.

Couple of weeks ago I had to go to Los Angeles on short notice.  Accordingly, 	paid full price and got in first class.  It must have been a new plane 	because the first class section was huge.  I sat in a chair that was like a 	lazy boy chair-it had a fott recline and everything.  Also had my own pop up 	TV and could watch  my choice of 4 movies.  It was truly awesome.  Can't 	believe what  a small world it is. Went to lobby to get somebreakfast and 	Patrick Brown was there-ended up having breakfast with him and some ohter 	Sempra folks.Then I had to go to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  Stayed at the 	new Alladin Hotel.  They upgraded me to a suite.  Another great experience.  	Bathroom was huge.  Big marble shower and  a  big tub that overlooked the 	skyline.  Bedroom area and sitting area were nice too.  Shame I was only 	there one night.		Last week was Gas Fair.  Lots of lunches and dinners. There are a lot of new 	restaurants downtown that we tried out.  Yum-yum. The weather was perfect.  	.  Cheri and I went to the spa and had a relaxing afternoon on the last day.  	She looks great.  She said you saw her picture of Matthew. He's a cutie.  	Parks was a t dinner one night-he hasn't changed-still nice as ever.  Had a 	lot of fun with Frank Fields too- he hasn't changed a bit .David Livingston 	was there.  He works for Cinergy but is doing east coast stuff-thank God.  	Our retail group  just hired Joe Deschamps and Chris Shireman-remember them?  	I bet Joe won't be there by the end of the year-I think he just wanted 	someone to pay for his way back to Houston.  Just found out that Bob Shiring 	went to work for Pan Canadian doing east coast stuff.		Joe's brother was in town this week-end from Montana.  He picked him up in 	San Antonio so we had them all week-end .  Went down to Kemah to watch the 	boats- we went there with Griff that one time.  Boy has it changed.  Tons 	more stuff to do -especially for the kids.		I'm just sick over my tax bill this year.  I exercised a ton of my 	options-and boy am I paying for it.  I was planning on  maybe paying $25000  	but I am having to pay $47000.  Will probably be that way next year too.  	Just sucks that the government takes so much.  I know I'm probably not 	getting much sympathy from you but I can try.		Can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week.  Bet you are 	glad your kids are almost out of school.  Can't understand how these kids 	have access to all of these guns.  It's scary.		Deb and I had lunch with Julia.   She's gone from Enron now.  She did not 	give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of 	town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense.  Her 	family still does not know she is married.  She is being really strange about 	this whole thing. She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married.  I've 	given up on her.  She is almost as strange as you at times.  Luckily I have 	not given up on you .		Going to Grand Cayman Islands on Thursday-plan on feeding the stingrays on 	Friday-will tell you all about it.		Tell me why you are too busy to fill me in on what is happenign in your life.

ABN Amro had a local branch in 	Brazil so the $R draws would have been relatively straight forward.  However, 	with Arab Bank's New York Branch, the way a draw would work is this:		-Petrobras sends fax to Arab bank indicating a draw request	-Arab Bank will send funds to Brazil through its Brazilian correspondent bank 	and convert dollars to $R.  There would be an FX trade and fee associated. (I 	assume that Enron would pick up the cost of this.)  		The one issue we need to consider is that any draw request would take 	approximately 24 hours as it involves a correspondent bank and FX trade.

I was talking to a Tozzini lawyer and he said that that language on the side 	letter (" reputable institution") is a kind of standard in Brazil for such 	kind of contracts but that it doesn't have any correlation to any  credit 	rating standard. So, I believe we won't have any problems with the l/c from 	Arab Bank.	I also read the fuel contract and realized that there is no restrictions or 	requirements for the  letter of credit except for its amount.		How is the l/c issuance going?

I would suggest that instead of writing it with no test on gas, just relax 	the requirement to where they have to meet the World Bank Guideline on gas.

Tracee - There is documentation on the KFW hedge as you know.  The only thing 	we could provide on the OPIC loan is a requirement of the lenders to be fixed 	which would be in the CTA if it was required in this instance (or the other 	OPIC documents).  It could be that the only requirement was in the OPIC FOGA 	which originally required us to be fixed within 12 months of funding.  	However, we modified this and now we must select either a Citibank bank loan 	which would be fixed prior to funding by a swap or if we issue bonds they 	will be fixed rate.

The penalties here are calculated as R$ 400 per 	delayed MW per day. 		(2) Penalties due to capacity shortfall (basically - are we able to meet 	dispatch requests). If the moving average of the monthly average of the 	projects equivalent availability, calculated in accordance with provisions of 	annex-7 of the PPA, is less than 92%, a penalty shall be assessed in the 	amount of monthly capacity portion of the tariff for each phase times the 	guaranteed capacity for the phase multiplied by (92% - moving average of the 	monthly availability).		Penalties type (1) does not apply in the concept analyzed as it relates to 	delay in gas (Force Majeure Claim issue). 		Refusing a dispatch request above 220 MW has an impact on penalties type (2) 	(guaranteed capacity is 300 MW). Given that the plant currently has a moving 	average of the monthly availability of about 99.7%, there is a margin built 	up that can be used to accept an availability hit by refusing a dispatch 	request above 220 MW. Therefore, to avoid the huge fuel costs associated with 	being dispatched above 220 MW, the PPA availability penalty concept can be 	utilized as an alternative. If we continue to decline to be dispatched above 	220 MW for a long period however, the built up margin will be reduced and 	eventually we'll have to pay penalties because the 12-month moving average 	moves below 92%.

I thought you and John were great, particularly John's step-in on 	the heat rate/degradation issue.  Thanks to both of you.		I also wanted to visit on the latest plan for the ridges.		Thirdly, I wanted to discuss your thoughts on the achievability of our 	positions with SCC and Siemens.		Finally, we should circle up on the TAA once we get Cliff's response.  He led 	me to believe that we really had little to fear in the discussion I had with 	him.		Regards		Rob

As you know DKB was 	also hired by Enron as the financial advisor to the Cuiaba project. We have 	about 800k to pay DKB at financial closint. Can you check to see  how DKB 	does not have a conflict of interest in this work. They need to either cease 	all work on the Petrobras transaction or terminate their work and rights to a 	fee for Cuiaba. Let me know what you think or if you need any more info
